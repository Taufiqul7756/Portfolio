Courses like Computer Organization and Architecture, Operating Systems provided me with the opportunity to acquire in-depth understandings of computer systems and system internals. I also did multiple projects which were inspired by various real-life problems. I did my final project named “Daffodil Shuttle” which can mitigate the notorious road transport issue if implemented. I also did “Robotics” as one of my elective courses to understand the automation system. I designed various kinds of games namely a racing game and a shooting game.",
